The online shopping portal is giving a buy-2 get-1 free discount.
There are various categories of goods and the offer is valid on a group of items if they belong to the same category.
All items in the same category are priced equal.
So, If you buy 3 items of category A, you pay only for 2 items.
But if you buy 2 items of category A and 1 of category B, you pay for all 3 items.
Given the categories for various items in your shopping cart and the price for each category,
calculate the total price that you will have to pay.

Input
Each test case will contain two lines.
First line will be a string comprising of only alphabets (only upper case)
Each character represents a category in the shop.
Next line will contain a space separated list of 26 integers where 1st integer is price for category A,
2nd integer is price for category B and 26th integer is price for category Z.
Output
For each test case, print on a single line the price that the customer will have to pay.

1 2 3 3 2 1 4 7 9 10 11 13 12 1 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 11 14 15
output
34

Explanation :-
A B C D E F G H I J  K  L  M  N O P Q R S T U V  W X  Y  Z
1 2 3 3 2 1 4 7 9 10 11 13 12 1 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 11 14 15

in the above input we have the frequency count of category as follows

      I * P  =  Amount
A-4 - 3 * 1  =   3
B-3 - 2 * 2  =   4
C-1 - 1 * 3  =   3
D-2 - 2 * 3  =   6
E-1 - 1 * 2  =   2
F-1 - 1 * 1  =   1
Z-1 - 1 * 15 =  15
       Total  =  34

if we buy two items we get one item free, so in 4 items of Category-A we have to bill only for 3 items
for Category B we have to bill only for 2 items.

In the above frequency I represents the Number of Items for each Category and P represent the cost
if we sum all of them we get the total price to be paid by the customer.

in the above input we have the frequency count of category as follows
      C *  P    AMOUNT
Z-4 - 3 * 12  =  36
A-3 - 2 * 17  =  34
B-2 - 2 *  5  =  10

D-3 - 2 *  3  =   6
R-6 - 4 *  6  =  24
T-4 - 3 *  8  =  24

S-1 - 1 *  7  =   7
E-1 - 1 *  2  =   2
F-1 - 1 *  1  =   1
       TOTAL  = 168
